# NOTICE!
This repo is here for archival purposes, and should only be used for reference. Code is a bit old. This was my first try at a multi-language project
If you are needing a monitor that works like this but with more features, I am developing a montior service that should be out in the coming months.

# About Scythe
The focus of this application is to scan and detect changes in products on several different shopify websites. Once a change is detected, it will send a discord notification to a select channel and edit the message when the stock changes. Below is a screenshot on how the monitor looks like in action.

This application would be used by resellers who need to be the first to know when a product drops, and with info provided, use various bots to try and buy the product the quickest to turn around and sell for profit.
